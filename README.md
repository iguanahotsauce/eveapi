eveapi
======

This is an application that uses HighStocks to create a graph of the lowest sell orders for a list of typeids from 
eve-central.com

It logs every new entry to eve-central.com in order to keep historical data.

There is a live demo available at barkculture.com/eveapi/templates/eveMarketStats.html

The database is a little slow and takes a few seconds to load so if the page comes up blank just give it a few seconds
and it will load

Each item is toggleable in the legend, so you can shut off all but one and view the stats for that specific typeid

Any feedback is greatly appreciated
